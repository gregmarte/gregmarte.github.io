    <h1>5 Rules for Team Members</h1>
    
    <p>During my time at Boats Group 2013-2016, we evolved a number of team culture frameworks.</p>
    <p>These are the 5 rules we established for team members to follow:</p><br>
    <ul style="text-align: center; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>Respect for People</strong> </li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Make all Work Visible </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Work in Priority Order</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Work as a Team</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Here’s a deeper dive:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Respect for People</strong> Everyone here is recognized for their ability to bring value to our organization. In all of our interactions and decisions, respect for all people is paramount to how we operate. This shows up in how we talk to another, how we listen, arriving to meetings on time, and seeking opportunities to increase our interconnectivity.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong> A company is an economic engine and growth is a key success factor to health and longevity. Financially we expect a 10-20% growth rate. How can you grow yourself and your abilities by 10% per year. What automations need to be put in place; what skill sets do you need to evolve into; what new technologies are emerging?</li><br>
      <li><strong>Make all Work Visible </strong> There’s 4 types of Value that we create. The easiest of these is Visibility. Make your work visible by choosing public Slack conversations over private ones, regular/daily status updates, insightful work comments on Jira tickets, active participation knowledge sharing sessions. By being visible we generate knowledge sharing, we allow others to jump in when we are moving towards danger/undesired outcomes, we build a collective group energy where the wins of the team are celebrated and built upon.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Work in Priority Order</strong>  In Jira this means working right to left, top to bottom. Knowing how a team picks up prioritized works allows for the invisible hand of coordination and predicability. Get the most important/valuable tasks to Done; let the other items safely drop. Working in Priority Order allows focus, and allows team members to respectfully say no, or say yes, dropping their currently committed piece of work for the greater good.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Work as a Team</strong> Where possible, and efficient, look for solution paths where you get to work together. If two people working together can get an item done in half the time (or better), absolutely make that happen. People working together have more fun, innovate, learn, and establish/reinforce culture norms and best practices.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>As with everything that we do, these are ordered by Priority, which is useful for handling dilemmas or situations when our values are in conflict. i.e., as a Manager if a team member is dealing with a personal issue, #3 suggests making my work visible, but that is overruled by #1, Respect for People.</p><br>
    <p>Other examples:</p><br>
    <p>As a team member we are often interrupted with requests for assistance, or noise based events. If it’s a quick ask, yes, we go out of our way to assist, but at any time we feel extended, we are allowed to lookup the task Priority(#4), assess against our current work, and make an informed decision. i.e. a kind way to say ‘no’.</p><br>
    <p>Or use your autonomy, go ahead and make any executive 'yes' decision, one that you feel the team would support, and let the team know in Slack (i.e. make it visible), and that's all the "manager approvals" needed.</p> <br>
    <p>And lastly, learning something new can be embarrassing. Culturally I’d like that to change and will do some group learning (AWS quizzes). Overall the net position of teams that I’ve worked with succeed with deep study/experimenting in private and demoed on success.</p>
